## Useful resources

As a newbie, I didn't know what should I learn first Python/Django, NodeJS or React... I was lost, then a Friday morning I remembered an idea I wanted to reallies after finding a learn-by-doing canvas examples, where we will create a web paint app. I said why not making it a shared application in real-time ! I just wanted to reallies this idea, so I searched for learn-by-doing and learn-by-examples tutorials so I can do something during my weekend, I had some problems and I googled for solutions :D .
